# Lab 05 - Solving for Carrots

This lab can be found [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/carrots) if you would like to give it a try yourself.

## Goal

The goal of this lab is find the amount of carrots given out. A carrot is given for every problem solved.

## Example

```
# I represents input and O represents output

I > make run
I > 2 1
I > description 1
I > description 2
O > 1
```

**Explaination**
- There are `2` contestants and `1` problem was solved.
- Therefore, since each problem solved = 1 carrot, 1 carrot was given out.
- The descriptions are useless clutter in this question.

## Running

- This lab can be ran using `make run`
- The test cases defined for this lab can be ran using `make tests`
