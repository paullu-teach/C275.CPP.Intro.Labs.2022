# Lab 07 - Quadarant Selection

This lab can be found [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/quadrant) if you would like to give it a try yourself.

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to output the quadrant of the given coordinates.

## Example

```
# I represents input and O represents output

I > make run
I > 10
I > 6
O > 1
```

**Explaination**

`10` and `6` can be converted to coordinates as `(10, 6)`. Given the quadrants, this is in quadrant `1` when graphed.

## Running

- This lab can be ran using `make run`
- The test cases defined for this lab can be ran using `make tests`
