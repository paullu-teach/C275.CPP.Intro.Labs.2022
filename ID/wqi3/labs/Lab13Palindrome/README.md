# Lab 13 - Palindrome Checking

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to determine if a string given is a palindrome. (can be read the same way backwards as forwards)

## Example

```
# I represents input and O represents output

I > make run
I > 7
I > racecar
O > Palindrome
```

**Explaination**
- There are 7 characters in the string we are about to check.
- The string is `racecar`
- If you spell it backwards, it is `racecar` still
- Therefore, it is a palindrome, and we output `Palindrome`

## Running

- This lab can be ran using `make run`
- The test cases defined for this lab can be ran using `make tests`
