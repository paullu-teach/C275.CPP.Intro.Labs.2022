# Lab 03 - R2

This lab can be found [here](https://open.kattis.com/problems/r2) if you would like to give it a try yourself.

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to find B in the formula R = (A + B) / 2 given A and then R.

## Example

```
# I represents input and O represents output

I > make run
I > 11 15
O > 19
```

**Explaination**
- Using the equation given, `(11 + B) / 2 = 15`
- We can change this to `15 * 2 - 11 = B`
- This shows that `B = 19`

## Running

- This lab can be ran using `make run`
- The test cases defined for this lab can be ran using `make tests`
