Solutions to C++ Intro Labs from 2022

## Setup
- Each directory in `labs` contains test cases that can be run using `make tests`
- However, the test case runner I built is written in node.js, it therefore requires the extra step of installing Node.js 
- `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

## How To Run a Lab
- Navigate to the directory of your choosing in your terminal
- Run `make run` to run the code and enter your own input (unless otherwise stated in its respective `README.md`)
- Run `make tests` to run the test cases for that specific lab
