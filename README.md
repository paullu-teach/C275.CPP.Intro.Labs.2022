# C275.CPP.Intro.Labs.2022
Solutions to C++ Intro Labs from 2022

Here are basic parameters of the contest:

1.  The instructors are the final judges and can alter the rules at any time. We will be reasonable.

2.  The contest runs from Tuesday, January 18 to Monday, February 7, 2022.

3.  Only students in CMPUT 275 are eligible for the prize.

4.  The student that shares the "best" solutions to the C++ intro labs (e.g., code) are eligible for the prize.

5.  Students have to solve at least 5 of the Kattis-based problems to be eligible.

6.  The criteria for best includes:  coding, **comments**, design, setup (e.g., makefile, input/output files)

7.  Students and TAs can nominate a winner (via a forthcoming Google Form), but the instructors will pick the winner.

8.  Any content put into this Git repo will be automatically licensed under GPL 3, and may be used in future years when teaching CMPUT 275.

9.  All submissions to the contest must be done via *pull requests* (PR) to this **public** Git repo:

	https://github.com/paullu-teach/C275.CPP.Intro.Labs.2022.git

10. We recommend using the "Forking Workflow" model described at:

	See "Forking Workflow With Pull Requests" at:

11. The first PR should be for a README.md file of the form: ID/"CCID"/README.md (see ID/paullu/README.md), where "CCID" is the CCID of the student.  If you do NOT want to use your CCID, contact Paul Lu.

By convention:  You can only write (i.e., via PR) into your "ID/"CCID"" directory, but everyone can read all files (per GPL 3.0)
